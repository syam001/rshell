Assignment 2
=======

This project is basically just a command shell that can read in commands
and execute them. 



Bugs and Errors
----------

There seems to be a problem that happens when you type a command,
backspace, and type over previously the previously written command.
This causes an error. I suspect it has something to do with how the 
commands are being parsed as they are being saved as the command is 
being written.
